# Lesson Plan Generator for Bantaladnua School

This Google Apps Script will generate the lesson plan table format into a Google Doc in the format requested by Bantaladnua School.

## How to Use

1. Open any empty Google Doc.
2. Navigate to `Extensions > Apps Script`.
3. Add the function from `apps_script.js`.
4. Before running the script, add an array of lesson plans based on the output schema from `lesson-plan-output-schema.json` as directed in the script.

## AI Prompt

To prompt the AI, copy the following prompt and paste it into the AI tool:

`prompt.txt`

The AI will create the lesson plan for you, and the script will generate the lesson plan document.

## Files Included

- `apps_script.js`: The Google Apps Script function.
- `lesson-plan-output-schema.json`: The schema for the `apps_script.js` lessonPlanJsonData array
- `lesson-plan-prompt-input-example.json`: The schema you give the AI prompt.

## If you don't use AI

You will need to manually write the `lesson-plan-output-schema.json`. You can copy the examples from `lesson-plans.json`.

## Example

Here is an example of how the lessonPlanJsonData array should look based on the schema:
